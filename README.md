# aperture_photometry
A code to perform aperture photometry on science images obtained through the 1.3m Devasthal Telescope.
We are in the process of developing a photometry pipeline, or order to reduce the science images obtained through the 1.3m Devasthal Telescope.

This is a work in progress as of now and we expect it to develop fully in a couple of months time. The salient features are:

1. This is being developed as a pure PYTHON software.
2. The dependence on IRAF tasks has been reduced to minimum.
3. To reduce the images we use CCDPROC alongwith our custom written tools.
4. The PYTHON package PHOTUTILS is being used for the photometry.

We aim it to develop it as a fast and easy to handle alternative to the users dependent on IRAF/DAOPHOT kind of software.

Currently, we are a team of 3 people, all working towards our PhD thesis and working on this as a side project:

1. Vivek kumar Jha
2. Dimple
3. Kiran Wani
